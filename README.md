Made with 4 people in Unity 

# Deputy Donut
"Deputy, we just had a call coming in that there is a donut truck destroying the city, 
and guess what? It has our donuts! We count on you to stop the truck at any cost, 
the government has given us these expensive things called power-ups and provided you 
with a state of the art car. So, it’s all in your hands now, go out there and destroy! 
Grab a buddy and strap in for Deputy Donut. An action packed, donut-themed, sandbox vehicle combat game. 
You don’t have to tell your buddy he is the one getting blown-up in the truck beforehand for best results.
